<math-expr|string>
Constraints expressions for '{var}' on 'boundary', 'skeleton' and 'volume' degrees of freedom. Default '<empty>'.
When the expression evaluates to 'null' the degree of freedom will be left unconstrained
and left to be solved (expect when using 'ExprTk'!). Otherwise, the resulting value on the
expression will be set as a constrain and the degree of freedom won't be modified when the system
is solved. When this option not set, the all the degrees of freedom for '{var}' will automatically be unconstrained.
The 'boundary' degrees of freedom refer to the coefficients bound to the boundary of the entire grid 
(i.e., not necessarily the compartment boundary). Warning: Time dependent constraints are currently unsupported.
