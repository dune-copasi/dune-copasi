<string|math-expr|integer>
Definition of a compartment in the grid

type=<string>
  Selects the type of compartment definition
    * gmsh_id: Select a phyisical entities from a Gmsh file.
    * expression: Create a compartment dynamically with a math expression.

gmsh_id=<integer>
  The phyisical entity id in the gmsh file

    This option can only be used together with 'compartments.{cmp}.type=gmsh_id' and
    'grid.path=path/to/gmsh/file'.

expression=<math-expr>
  Expression that defines a compartment in terms of a function.
    If the expression evaluates to a value different than zero in the center of an entity,
    such entity is assigned to the compartment '{cmp}'. For example, an the expression
    'compartements.top.expression=\"position_y > 0.5\"' defines a compartment '{cmp}' with
    name 'top' that is only defined for the top half of an square grid
    This option can only be used together with 'compartments.{cmp}.type=expression'.

parser_type=<string>
