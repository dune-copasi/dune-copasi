<type | path>
Sets up a token '{tkn}' in the dune-copasi parsers based on grid data corresponding with the loaded grid

type=<string>
  Type of token '{tkn}' within the dune-copasi parsers
    Possible selections are:
      * scalar:        	Sets token '{tkn}' as a scalar double. 
      * vector:       	Sets token '{tkn}' as a vector double. [not implemented - WIP]
      * tensor:         Sets token '{tkn}' as a tensor double. [not implemented - WIP]

path=<string>
  The path of the file containing values for '{tkn}' for the defined enities values
    This option can only be used together if the grid was loaded from a Gmsh file (i.e. using grid.path)
    The griddata file needs to provide the values (can be scalar (double), vector (D x double) or tensor (D x D x double))
    of the entities to which the values needs to be assigned. To do this you need to take advantage of the Gmsh file type (v2).
    Each cell entity in the Gmsh has a unique integer as identifier (lets call it gmsh_cell_id_n). The first line in the 
    data-file should contain the number of values to assign. The following lines contain the data and start with the
    gmsh_cell_id followed by the values (scalar one double, vector D double and tensor DxD doubles space separated). Lines
    starting with '#' are not read. A simple example for a scalar is:
    
    	# not read
	N_values
	gmsh_cell_id1 double
	gmsh_cell_id2 double
	...
