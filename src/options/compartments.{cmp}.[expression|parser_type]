<string|math-expr|integer>
Compartment definition of with name '{cmp}' as a sub-domain of the grid
Compartments represent one sub-domain within the grid where the model scalar fields have support.
There must be at least one non-empty compartment.

expression=<math-expr>
  Expression that defines a compartment in terms of a function evaluated on grid entities
    If the expression evaluates to a value different than zero in the center of a grid entity,
    such entity is assigned to the compartment '{cmp}'. For example, an the expression
    'compartments.top.expression=\"position_y > 0.5\"' defines a compartment '{cmp}' with
    name 'top' that is only defined for the top half of an squared grid.
    If the grid was read from a gmsh file (i.e., 'grid.path=path/to/gmsh/file'), the parser
    will additionally know the `gmsh_id` for each of entity. For example, an expression of the form
    'compartments.gmsh_domain.expression = (gmsh_id == 2)' will be a compartment with name
    'gmsh_domain' with entities that have a gmsh id equal to '2'.

parser_type=<string>
  Parser type of the compartment expression
