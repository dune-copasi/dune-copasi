<string|math-expr|integer>
Definition of a compartment in the grid

expression=<math-expr>
  Expression that defines a compartment in terms of a function.
    If the expression evaluates to a value different than zero in the center of an entity,
    such entity is assigned to the compartment '{cmp}'. For example, an the expression
    'compartements.top.expression=\"position_y > 0.5\"' defines a compartment '{cmp}' with
    name 'top' that is only defined for the top half of an square grid.
    If the grid was read from a gmsh file (i.e., 'grid.path=path/to/gmsh/file'), the parser
    will aditionally know the `gmsh_id` for each of entity. For example, an expression of the form
    'compartements.gmsh_domain.expression = (gmsh_id == 2)' will be a compartment with name
    'gmsh_domain' with entities that have a gmsh id equal to '2'.
