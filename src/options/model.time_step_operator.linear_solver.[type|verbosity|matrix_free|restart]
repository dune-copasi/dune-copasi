<string|integer|bool>
Options of the linear solver. Default (first found): UMFPack|SuperLU|BiCGSTAB

type=<string>
  Type of the linear solver
    Possible options are:
    * 'RestartedGMRes'
    * 'CG'
    * 'BiCGSTAB'
    * 'UMFPack'
    * 'SuperLU'

restart=<integer>
  Number of iterations before the Gram-Schmidt orthognialization is restarted
    This option can only be used together with 'type=RestartedGMRes'.

matrix_free=<bool>
  Whether to perform computations with matrix-free methods in the linear solver. Default: false
    In general, the matrix-free version will require less memory but will take more
    computation time to calculate the jacobian application. Additionally,
    it is not compatible with direct solvers.
