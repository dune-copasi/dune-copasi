<float|bool>
Define the initial value and quietness of an evaluation/reduction/transformation algorithm on grid functions. Default: {0., false}

  initial.value=<float>:
    Initial value of the evaluation/reduction/transformation algorithm for the token '{key}'

  quiet=<bool>:
    If 'true', the evaluation/reduction/transformation algorithm will only report its result on failure.
