<string|integer>
Options forh the execution policy on the assembly of residuals and jacobians

type=<string>
  Type of execution policy
    * sequential:     The assembly of residuals/jacobians is sequenced one after the other.
    * concurrent:       The assembly of residuals/jacobians is made concurrently

partition.type=<string>
  Type of partition of the grid entities. Only used if 'model.assembly.partition.type=concurrent'
    * METIS:          Partition the grid patches using METIS library
    * Simple:         Partition the grid patches by naively splitting the grid iterator

partition.patches=<integer>
  Number of patches to partition the grid

partition.coloring=<string>
  Whether to use a coloring for a synchronization free assembly
    * None:         No Coloring and use local basis lock to sincronize accumulation to residuals/jacobians
    * DSatur:       Use DSatur algorithm to find patches free of synchronization requirements
