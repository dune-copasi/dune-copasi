<float>
Time-step settings of the simulation. Default: {0.1, 0.5, 1.1, <empty>, <empty>}
In case of time-step success, the subsequent time-step will be increased by this factor
In case of time-step failure, the subsequent time-step will be decreased by this factor
Maximum time-step that the simulation is allowed to make
Minimum time-step that the simulation is allowed to make
