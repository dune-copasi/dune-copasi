string
Expression of an inline function for the token '{tkn}'
The expression must start with a comma serparated list of tknuments
and split with the function content with a colon. For example:
'parser_context.pow2.expression = \"x: x^2\"' defines a function that may be
called as 'pow(1.)' in the context of parsed expressions. Note that functions
call other functions parser context.
This option can only be used together with 'parser_context.{tkn}.type=function'.
