<integer|string|integer-list|float-list>
Parameters to read or define a grid
Reads or defines a grid. If a file is not provided with the 'path' option, an
structured grid will be automatically generated with a given 'origin', 'extensions', and 'cells'.

dimension=<integer>
  Dimension of the simulation

path=<string>
  Path to a Gmsh file containing a grid

cells=<integer-list>
  Numbers of cells per dimension direction. Default: one-per-dimension (e.g., '1 1 1' in 3D)
  This option can only be used if no 'grid.path=/path/to/grid' was given.

extnsions=<float-list>
  Extensions of an squared domain. Default: unit square (e.g., '1. 1. 1.' in 3D)
  This option can only be used if no 'grid.path=/path/to/grid' was given.

origin=<float-list>
  Position of the origin of an squared domain. Default: caresian origin (e.g., '0. 0. 0.' in 3D)
  This option can only be used if no 'grid.path=/path/to/grid' was given.

refinement_level=<integer>
  Refinement level of the grid at the beginning of the simulation.  Default: 0

axis_names=<string-list>
  Names given to the axis of the grid. Default: ['x', 'y', 'z']
  These names are used to identify the cartesian components of several parameters in the
  program (e.g. 'position_x', 'model.scalar_field.{var}.velocity.z.initial.expression', etc).
  Through the rest of the documentation, they are assumed to be the default ones.
