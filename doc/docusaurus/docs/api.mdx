### Doxygen Documentation

The C++ classes are documented in the C++ source code and may be visualized with
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html). To locally have the doxygen html
documentation, build `dune-copasi` [manually](install_use) and use the
`make dune-copasi-doxygen` target in the build directory. For this, you need to
have `doxygen` on your system.
