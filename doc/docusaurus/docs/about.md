**dune-copasi** is a library that provides numerical simulators for
reaction-diffusion systems on single and multiple compartments. It does this by
providing [C++ classes](install_use) that represent solution states as well as the
means to evolve them with respect to time. It also provide *ready-to-use*
executables able to perform forward simulations. Both C++ classes and executables
may be configured using a convenient [Parameter Tree](param_tree).
