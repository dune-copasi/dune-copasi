`DuneCopasi` is a library that provides numerical solutions of
reaction-diffusion systems on single and multiple compartments. We do so by
providing [C++ classes](api.md) that represent a solution state as well as the
means to evolve them with respect to time. We also provide **ready-to-use**
executables able to perform forward simulations. Both classes and executables
shall be configured using a [Parameter Tree](param_tree.md).
