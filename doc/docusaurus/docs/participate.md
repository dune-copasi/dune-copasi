There are several ways you can participate.

* **Improve user manual**: The user manual is a key part part for both learning
  and developing new features. If you happen to find a typo, find an
  undocumented feature or want to rephrase an existing one, feel free to send us
  a short *Merge Request* or *Issue* to our
  [GitLab](https://gitlab.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi).
* **Report bugs**: You may be using the program and experience unexpected
  behavior, this may either come from wrong input data or from a `dune-copasi`
  component not working as intended. If you suspect is the latter one, first
  check the [bug tracker] to see if someone else is having the same problem,
  otherwise, [let us know]!
* **Contribute with code**: If you happen know how to fix a bug, add a feature,
  extend the package, etc. and want to do it, we would be very plased to
  receive a *Merge Request* with your contributions. Read the
  [contribution guide] for more information.
