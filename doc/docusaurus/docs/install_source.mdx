:::caution development
These are the instruction for the development branch of DuneCopasi!
:::

:::tip docker build
This mode of installation is recommended only for [API usage](use_api), immersive developemt,
or cases where upstream dependencies need to be modified. In other cases, you can easily modify
the source code, build it, and use it through a [docker installation](install_docker) without needing
to install the dependencies.
:::

:::note Operating Systems and Compilers
The installation from source is known to compile and run under Debian/Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
In all three cases with [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) and [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org)
based compilers. It is known to be **not** compatible with Microsoft Visual Studio.
:::

### Dependencies

Locally building and installing DuneCopasi requires a variety of dependencies:

:::caution development branches
Many of these dependencies are in a development branch (e.g., `master`) because DuneCopasi is also under developemt
or because the package does not offer other tagged release.

* **automatic**: The requirement is automatically fetched from the internet by CMake.
See the [CMake configuration options](#cmake-configuration-options) on how to enable/disable this feature.
* **optional**: The software package is not mandatory (but recommended) to build DuneCopasi.

:::note MPI and FFTW requirements
The MPI and FFTW packages are only to fulfill the requirements of parafields-core.
If these packages are present if your system, CMake can resolve parafields-core automatically by setting the option
`DUNE_COPASI_DISABLE_FETCH_PACKAGE_parafields` to `OFF` in CMake.

### Dune Options File

An important part of the installation procedure is to tune the build system
flags to accommodate the build options to your system: this is done via the [dune options
file](https://dune-project.org/doc/installation/#storing-flags-in-an-options-file).
In essence, is just a bash script that sets different flags (mainly the flags
for CMake `CMAKE_FLAGS`). While the dune project usually leaves this open for the user, we
provide a `dune-copasi.opts` file with sensible default options for the main
operating systems.

This file can be executed to show the current configuration:

```bash
./dune-copasi.opts
```

There are two forms to add flags to the `dune-copasi.opts` file:

1. Setting environmental variables starging with `CMAKE_` and `DUNE_`.
   These variables will be automatically included into the list of cmake flags.

  ```bash
  export CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/path/to/install/prefix/"
  export CMAKE_GENERATOR="'Ninja'"
  ./dune-copasi.opts
  ```

2. Appending new flags into the `CMAKE_FLAGS` variable in the `dune-copasi.opts` file
  (care must be taken to scape quotes):

  ```bash
  echo 'CMAKE_FLAGS+=" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/prefix/"' >> dune-copasi.opts
  echo "CMAKE_FLAGS+=\" -DCMAKE_GENERATOR='Ninja'\"" >> dune-copasi.opts
  ./dune-copasi.opts
  ```

For more information about the possible options and the dune options file, check out
the dune [installation documentation](https://dune-project.org/doc/installation/)
and its [build system documentation](https://dune-project.org/sphinx/core-2.7/).

### CMake configuration options

The following is the list of options to customize the build of DuneCopasi

| `CACHE:TYPE=DEFAULT` | Description |
| ---------| -------------- |
| `DUNE_COPASI_WITH_EXECUTABLE:BOOL=ON`                           | Build dune-copasi executable |
| `DUNE_COPASI_CONCURRENT_ASSEMBLY:BOOL=ON`                       | Build with concurrent assembly. Turn off to reduce memory consumption |
| `DUNE_COPASI_PRECOMPILED_MODE:BOOL=ON`                          | Pre-build a fixed set of class instances |
| `DUNE_COPASI_GRID_DIMENSIONS:STRING="2"`                        | Semi-colon separated list of dimensions to build |
| `DUNE_COPASI_${dim}D_DIFFUSION_REACTION_FEM_ORDERS:STRING="1"`  | Semi-colon separated list of finite element order to compile for dimension `${dim}`|
| `DUNE_COPASI_DISABLE_FETCH_PACKAGE_ExprTk:BOOL=OFF`             | Disable automatic fetch of ExprTk package |
| `DUNE_COPASI_DISABLE_FETCH_PACKAGE_parafields:BOOL=OFF`         | Disable automatic fetch of parafields-core package |
| `DUNE_COPASI_DISABLE_FMT_STYLE:BOOL=OFF`                        | Disable \{fmt\} styling |
| `DUNE_PDELAB_ENABLE_TRACING:BOOL=ON`                            | Enable automatic fetch of perfetto |

:::tip Memory usage
The building stage is known to take substantial memory during compilation (varies depending on the compiler).
If your system fails to build due to insufficient memory, try serializing the build process with the `-j {cores}` flag
and disabling some of the features.
:::

### Build and Install

:::danger DUNE Version incompatibility
Notice that this procedure assumes that you don't have previous installation of DUNE in
your system. If that's the case, uninstall DUNE before continuing, otherwise, version
conflicts may be difficult if not impossible to resolve!
:::

The required DUNE modules (including DuneCopasi) can be obtained via
internet by using [`git`](https://git-scm.com/). For smooth installation, is
better place all the dune modules within the same directory:

```bash
# prepare a folder to download and build dune modules
mkdir ~/dune-modules && cd ~/dune-modules

# fetch dependencies & dune-copasi in ~/dune-modules folder
git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-common
git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-geometry
git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-grid
git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/staging/dune-uggrid
git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-istl
git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-localfunctions
git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/staging/dune-functions
git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/extensions/dune-multidomaingrid
git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/staging/dune-typetree
git clone -b feature/dune-assembler/main-multithreaded https://gitlab.dune-project.org/pdelab/dune-pdelab
git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi
```

Then, build and install the DUNE modules with the `dunecontrol` script from `dune-common`:

```bash
# choose an installation path          (this is read by the 'dune-copasi.opts' file)
export CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/dune

# uncomment if you have MPI and FFTW
# export DUNE_COPASI_DISABLE_FETCH_PACKAGE_parafields=OFF

# configure and build dune modules                              (go grab a coffee ☕)
./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --opts=dune-copasi/dune-copasi.opts all

# install binaries and libraries                                (may require sudo 🔒)
./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --opts=dune-copasi/dune-copasi.opts bexec make install

# remove source and build files
cd ~ && rm -r ~/dune-modules

# include dune binaries into your path (if you use bash)
echo "export PATH=${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin:\$PATH" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

:::tip Active development cycle
An active development cycle does not need you to install the packages.
Instead, you can run the program directly in the build directory (i.e., `bin/dune-copasi`). In that case, we recommend
using `--builddir` option from `dunecontrol` in order to keep all the DUNE build directorties out of the source code.

the [dune-project web page](https://www.dune-project.org/doc/installation/).

### Run the program

Once installed, the program `dune-copasi` will be available on the command line and be ready for [CLI usage](use_cli):
