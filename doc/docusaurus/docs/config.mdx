In order to configure DuneCopasi, a set of configuration options must be provided.
When using the [GUI](use_gui), the program will automatically them set up for you. On the other hand, in the
case of [CLI](use_cli) and [API](use_cli) usage, they need to be manually specified.

In the following documentation pages we will assume that you are working with the [CLI](use_cli).
The [API](use_cli) essentially consists on the same options sythetized in the
[`Dune::ParameterTree`](https://www.dune-project.org/doxygen/2.9.1/classDune_1_1ParameterTree.html) C++ object.
