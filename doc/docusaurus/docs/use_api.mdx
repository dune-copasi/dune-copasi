The DuneCopasi C++ objects may be consumed by other programs in order
to generate custom simulation rules, to couple intermediate steps with other
tools, or to implement a GUI, etc. In such a case, DuneCopasi must be
available in development mode and the downstream library is expected to
[consume the library](#importing-cmake-targets) by using the
[CMake build system](https://cmake.org) and use the [C++ objects](api) in code.


### Importing CMake targets

To use the API for development, you must find and consume the CMake targets from DuneCopasi in your project as follows:

```cmake title="CMakeLists.txt"
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16 FATAL_ERROR)
project(my-app CXX)
# ...
find_package(dune-copasi IMPORTED REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE Dune::Copasi)
# ...
```

If DuneCopasi was installed on a custom directory
(e.g. using `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/dune`), it may be possible that you need to
pass such directory to the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` when building the project. This way,
CMake can find our targets and configuration:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:PATH=/opt/dune /path/to/app/source/
```
