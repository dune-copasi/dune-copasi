In this form, we provide one executable named `dune-copasi` for running forward simulations from the command line.
This executable is completely configurable from the command line arguments passed to it.

### Configuration options

By running the program with the command line arguments `--help` or `--help-full`, it will result in the
possible configuration options to run the program:

<DuneCopasiHelp/>

Alternatively, this online documentation also has the list of possible [configuration options](param_tree).

### Version

By running the program with the command line argument `--version`, you can find out the installed version of DuneCopasi:

<ExampleTerminal title="Getting DuneCopasi version">
  {[
    {
      input: "dune-copasi --version",
      output: [
      "2.0.0",
      ]
    }
  ]}
</ExampleTerminal>

### Running the program

:::tip working directory
Be aware that the [output files](output) produced by DuneCopasi are relative to the directory where
`dune-copasi` is started, hence, it is recommended to run the program within a working directory, for example `~/dune-copasi`.
:::

When passing configuration options to the command line arguments like `--config={path}`, or
`--{key}={value}`, the simulation will start and the program will stream its log output into the terminal:

<ExampleTerminal prompt="~/dune-copasi$" title="Running DuneCopasi">
  {[
    {
      input: "dune-copasi --config=config.ini",
      output: [
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.479] [info] Reading configuration file '~/dune-copasi/config.ini'",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.479] [info] Starting dune-copasi (version: 2.0.0)",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.580] [info] Axis names are set to: [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]",
      "...",
      "...",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.723] [info] dune-copasi successfully finished :)",
      ]
    }
  ]}
</ExampleTerminal>
