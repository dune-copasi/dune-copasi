A piece of software is nothing without who maintains it **and** who uses it.
We all form the community that make this package to be useful around the globe.

## DUNE

[`DUNE`](https://www.dune-project.org/), the *Distributed and Unified Numerics
Environment* is a modular toolbox for solving partial differential equations
(PDEs) with grid-based methods. It is the framework that `DuneCopasi` uses to
assemble and solve the numerical problems. The very well designed [`DUNE`
grid](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00607-008-0003-x)
has a tremendous influence on how `DuneCopasi` is designed.

## Biological Cell Modelling

In the biology community there is an effort to produce software that is able
model spatio-temporal variations of molecule distributions in living cells.
This project itself is an initiative of the [`COPASI`](http://copasi.org/)
developers to fill this gap for determinitic reaction networks.

### Spatial Model Editor

The [Spatial Model Editor](https://github.com/lkeegan/spatial-model-editor) is
a **user friendly** Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the
*Systems Biology Markup Language* ([SBML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBML)).
The GUI is able to read and modify non-spatial SBML models into 2D spatial
models and simulate them with `DuneCopasi`. A big adventage of this package is
that is tailored specifically for biologists and is availalbe with just a pair
of clicks on the major plataforms.
