One of the easiest form to use our executables for [CLI usage](use_cli), is by downloading and running a
[Docker Container](https://www.docker.com/). This way, the software is boundled in a container
such that no installation other than docker is required.

### Install Docker
First, get and install Docker following the
[docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Get the Container

To get the container from the [container registry](https://gitlab.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/container_registry), type:

```bash
docker pull registry.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi:master
docker tag registry.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi:master dune-copasi
```

The first line downloads the container from the internet while second one creates a tagged alias named `dune-copasi` so that it is easier to recall.

If you want to work with different docker container versions of DuneCopasi, make sure that your local aliases do not collied!

Once this is done, your terminal should look something similar to this:

<ExampleTerminal title="pulling dune-copasi docker image">
  {[
    {
      input: "docker pull registry.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi:master",
      output: [
        "master: Pulling from copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi",
        "09dd50cc7a64: Pull complete",
        "820c3cdfe17d: Pull complete",
        "c91c7d9f3fb1: Pull complete",
        "4928c27b1e25: Pull complete",
        "6fe40e7737d8: Pull complete",
        "7b80474789e1: Pull complete",
        "bd9ddc54bea9: Pull complete",
        "Digest: sha256:56feba94d0acf8f392eb835a9c25fdbd2124a199ea55cee3ff9635a3871fd597",
        "Status: Downloaded newer image for registry.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi:master",
        "registry.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi:master",
      ]
    },{
      input: "docker tag registry.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi:master dune-copasi",
    },{
      input: "docker images",
      output: [
        "REPOSITORY    TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE",
        "dune-copasi   master     acb239d6253e   2 seconds ago  337MB",
        "...",
      ]
    }
  ]}
</ExampleTerminal>

You can check that the container is working correctly by running the `--help` command.

```bash
docker run dune-copasi --help
```

An output similar to the following should be emitted:

<DuneCopasiHelp prefix="docker run "/>

### Prepare a working directory

To be able to easily share data between your operating system and the docker
container, prepare a working directory with read/write rights to _other users_
(e.g., a folder named `workdir`):

<ExampleTerminal prompt="~/workdir$" title="creating working directory">
  {[
    {
      input: "mkdir -m o+rw workdir",
      prompt: "~$",
    },{
      input: "cd workdir",
      prompt: "~$",
    }
  ]}
</ExampleTerminal>

This working directory will be accessible to your text editor, paraview as
well as to the `dune-copasi` executable inside the docker container. Now, you can
move or create your configuration files into it at will:

<ExampleTerminal prompt="~/workdir$" title="creating a configuration file">
  {[{
      input: [
        "echo \"",
        "[grid]",
        "dimension = 2",
        "...",
        "[model.time_step_operator]",
        "time_begin = 1",
        "time_end = 4",
        "\" > config.ini"],
    }
  ]}
</ExampleTerminal>

### Run the program

Now you are ready to use the program through the [Command Line Interface](use_cli) via docker. To do so, call the docker container with a configuration
file `config.ini`:

```bash
docker run -v $PWD dune-copasi --config=config.ini
```

This the docker container in the current directory (that's what `-v $PWD` means),
passes the rest of the arguments to the `dune-copasi` executable that exists the docker container, and
the results of the computations will be written on current directory.
In this case, the argument passed to the underlying executable are `--config=config.ini`.
Finally, when the simulation finishes, the last line of terminal should say whether the simulation was successful, for example:

<ExampleTerminal prompt="~/workdir$" title="how to run dune-copasi">
  {[
    {
      input: "docker run -v $PWD dune-copasi --config=config.ini",
      output: [
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.479] [info] Reading configuration file '~/workdir/config.ini'",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.479] [info] Starting dune-copasi (version: 2.0.0)",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.580] [info] Axis names are set to: [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]",
      "...",
      "...",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.723] [info] dune-copasi successfully finished :)",
      ]
    }
  ]}
</ExampleTerminal>

## Docker Build

Advanced users, who may want to make modifications the DuneCopasi
code but do not to install all the dependencies may opt for a [Docker Build](https://docs.docker.com/build/).
In this case, you must download the DuneCopasi source code, modify it as needed, and build
a new local docker image:

```bash
# fetch source code from git
git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi

# enter dune-copasi directory
cd dune-copasi

# checkout the branch you want to modify (e.g. latest)
git checkout latest

# modify source code at will
# ...

# build a new docker image from modified code (tag: dune-copasi)
docker build -t dune-copasi .
```

This will build all dune dependencies as well as the new modified version of the
`dune-copasi` executable within the docker container. Running the program works exactly as we discussed [above](##run-the-program).
