One of the easiest form to use our executables for [CLI usage](use_cli), is by downloading and running a
[Docker Container](https://www.docker.com/). This way, the software is boundled in a container
such that no installation other than docker is required.

### Install docker
First, get and install Docker following the
[docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Get the container

To get the container from the [container registry](https://gitlab.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/container_registry), run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
docker pull registry.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi:master
docker tag registry.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi:master dune-copasi
```

The first line downloads the container from the internet while second one creates a tagged alias named `dune-copasi` so that it is easier to recall.

:::tip alias collition
If you want to work with different containers from DuneCopasi, make sure that your local aliases do not collide!
:::

Once this is done, your terminal should look something similar to this:

<ExampleTerminal title="Pulling DuneCopasi docker image">
  {[
    {
      input: "docker pull registry.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi:master",
      output: [
        "master: Pulling from copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi",
        "09dd50cc7a64: Pull complete",
        "820c3cdfe17d: Pull complete",
        "c91c7d9f3fb1: Pull complete",
        "4928c27b1e25: Pull complete",
        "6fe40e7737d8: Pull complete",
        "7b80474789e1: Pull complete",
        "bd9ddc54bea9: Pull complete",
        "Digest: sha256:56feba94d0acf8f392eb835a9c25fdbd2124a199ea55cee3ff9635a3871fd597",
        "Status: Downloaded newer image for registry.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi:master",
        "registry.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi:master",
      ]
    },{
      input: "docker tag registry.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi/dune-copasi:master dune-copasi",
    },{
      input: "docker images",
      output: [
        "REPOSITORY    TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE",
        "dune-copasi   master     acb239d6253e   2 seconds ago  337MB",
        "...",
      ]
    }
  ]}
</ExampleTerminal>

You can check that the container is working correctly by running the `--help` command:

```bash
docker run dune-copasi --help
```

An output similar to the following should be emitted:

<DuneCopasiHelp prefix="docker run "/>

### Prepare a working directory

To be able to easily share data between your operating system and the docker
container, prepare a working directory with read/write rights to _other users_
(e.g., a folder named `workdir`):

<ExampleTerminal prompt="~/workdir$" title="Creating a working directory">
  {[
    {
      input: "mkdir -m o+rw workdir",
      prompt: "~$",
    },{
      input: "cd workdir",
      prompt: "~$",
    }
  ]}
</ExampleTerminal>

This working directory will be accessible to your local text editor, paraview as
well as to the `dune-copasi` executable within the docker container. Now, you can
move or create your configuration files into it at will, for example:

import TestINI from '!!raw-loader!/tutorials/assets/ini/test.ini';

<CodeBlock language="ini" title="~/workdir/config.ini" showLineNumbers>
{TestINI}
</CodeBlock>


### Run the program

At this point, you are ready to use the program through the [Command Line Interface](use_cli) via docker. To do so, call the docker container with a configuration
file `config.ini`:

:::tip[Configuration Options]
For more information on the possible options to successfully run a simulation, make sure to visit the [Command Line Interface](use_cli), the [Configuration Options](param_tree), and the [Tutorials](/tutorials) documentations!
:::

```bash
docker run -v $PWD:/dunecopasi dune-copasi --config=config.ini
```

This mounts the docker container working directory `/dunecopasi` in the current directory `$PWD` and
passes the rest of the arguments to the `dune-copasi` executable that exists within the docker container in the same way as with the [CLI usage](use_cli).
In this manner, the argument passed to the underlying executable is `--config=config.ini` while the results
of the computations will be written on current directory `$PWD`.

When the simulation is finished, the last line of terminal should say whether the simulation was successful, for example:

<ExampleTerminal prompt="~/workdir$" title="Running DuneCopasi">
  {[
    {
      input: "docker run -v $PWD:/dunecopasi dune-copasi --config=config.ini",
      output: [
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.479] [info] Reading configuration file '~/workdir/config.ini'",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.479] [info] Starting dune-copasi (version: 2.0.0)",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.580] [info] Axis names are set to: [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]",
      "...",
      "...",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.723] [info] dune-copasi successfully finished :)",
      ]
    }
  ]}
</ExampleTerminal>

## Docker build

Advanced users, who may want to make modifications the DuneCopasi
code but do not to install all the dependencies may opt for a local [Docker Build](https://docs.docker.com/build/).
For this, you must download the DuneCopasi source code, modify it as needed, and build
a new local docker image as follows:

```bash
# fetch source code from git
git clone https://gitlab.dune-project.org/copasi/dune-copasi

# enter dune-copasi directory
cd dune-copasi

# checkout the branch you want to modify (e.g. latest)
git checkout latest

# modify source code at will
# ...

# build a new docker image from modified code (tag: dune-copasi)
docker build -t dune-copasi .

# (optional) run unit, system and tutorial tests on the new docker image
docker build --target test-env -t dune-copasi-test .
```

This will build all dune dependencies as well as the new modified version of the `dune-copasi` executable within the docker container.
Running the program works exactly as we discussed [above](#run-the-program).
