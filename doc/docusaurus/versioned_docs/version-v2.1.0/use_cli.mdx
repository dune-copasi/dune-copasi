:::tip Installation Guide
Check out our [Installation Documentation](install) to find the optimal way to install `dune-copasi` and access the Command Line Interface!
:::

:::tip CLI on the Web Browser
If you're interested in exploring and using the Command Line Interface (CLI) without installation, you're in luck! The [Web Browser executable](try) allows you to interact with the CLI directly from any device. No setup requiredâ€”just open your browser and start experimenting!
:::

In this form, we provide one executable named `dune-copasi` for running forward simulations from the command line.
This executable is completely configurable from the command line arguments passed to it.

### Configuration options

By running the program with the command line arguments `--help` or `--help-full`, it will result in the
possible configuration options to run the program:

<DuneCopasiHelp/>

:::tip[Configuration Options]
For more information on the possible options to successfully run a simulation, make sure to visit the [Configuration Options](param_tree), and the [Tutorials](/tutorials) documentations!
:::

### Version

By running the program with the command line argument `--version`, you can find out the installed version of DuneCopasi:

<ExampleTerminal title="Getting DuneCopasi version">
  {[
    {
      input: "dune-copasi --version",
      output: [
      "2.1.0",
      ]
    }
  ]}
</ExampleTerminal>

### Running the program

By parsing a initialization file `config.ini` to the DuneCopasi solver it will exactly know how to construct the problem and the simulation will be started.
Once it finished you should get the message `dune-copasi successfully finished :)` by the end simulation logs.

:::tip configuration file example
Having installed we are now set to test the DuneCopasi solver.
To do this we will create a simple initialization file. We write the code of the minimal example to the file `config.ini`:

<CodeBlock language="ini" title="~/workdir/config.ini" showLineNumbers>
{TestINI}
</CodeBlock>

In case of the example above, you have just set up the heat equation with an initial Gaussian distribution (it doesn't save it though).

Note that the [output files](output) produced by DuneCopasi are relative to the directory where
`dune-copasi` is started, hence, it is recommended to run the program within a working directory, for example `~/workdir`.

:::warning[Simulation Failed?]
A failed simulation may look instead like this:

<ExampleTerminal prompt="~/workdir$" title="Running DuneCopasi (failure)">
  {[
    {
      input: "dune-copasi --config=config.ini",
      output: [
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.479] [info] Reading configuration file '~/workdir/config.ini'",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.479] [info] Starting dune-copasi (version: 2.0.0)",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.580] [info] Axis names are set to: [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]",
      "...",
      "...",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.723] [error] Dune reported error:",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.723] [error]   Message:        Basis has dimension 0, make sure to have at least one 'scalar_field' with a non-empty 'compartment'",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.723] [error]   Exception type: Dune::InvalidStateException",
      "[2024-03-21 12:38:32.723] [error] dune-copasi finished with some errors :(",
      ]
    }
  ]}
</ExampleTerminal>

If your simulation failed, it's worth to ask yourself the following questions:

* What are the contents of your configuration options and what's the expected behavior?
* What are the **warning** and **error** logs provided by program? Do they give you hints on how to solve the problem?
* What is stage of the simulation where the problem failed?

In particular, remember that providing no configuration options gives an invalid simulation
(what would be the simulation for this?), therefore the program rightfully fails.
