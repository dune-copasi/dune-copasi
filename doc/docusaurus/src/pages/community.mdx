# Community

A piece of software is nothing without who maintains it **and** who uses it.
We all form the community that make this package to be useful around the globe.

## DUNE

[DUNE](https://www.dune-project.org/), the _**D**istributed and **U**nified **N**umerics
**E**nvironment_ is a modular toolbox for solving partial differential equations
(PDEs) with grid-based methods. It is the framework that DuneCopasi uses to
assemble and solve the numerical problems. The very well designed [DUNE
grid](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00607-008-0003-x)
has a tremendous influence on how DuneCopasi is designed.

## Biological Cell Modelling

In the biology community there is an effort to produce software that is able
model spatio-temporal variations of molecule distributions in living cells.
This project itself is an initiative of the [COPASI](http://copasi.org/)
developers to fill this gap for determinitic reaction networks.

### Spatial Model Editor

The [Spatial Model Editor](spatial_model_editor) is
a **user friendly** Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the
*Systems Biology Markup Language* ([SBML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBML)).
The GUI is able to read and modify non-spatial SBML models into 2D spatial
models and simulate them with DuneCopasi. A big advantage of this package is
that is tailored specifically for biologists and is available with just a pair
of clicks on the major plataforms.
