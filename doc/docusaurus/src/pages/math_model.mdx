# Mathematical Model

In the following, we describe in mathemathical terms the actual model problem
that we want to solve.

## Continuous Problem

In principle, we want to describe processes which are *continuously* observable in
time and space (e.g.
[continuum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics#Concept_of_a_continuum)).
Additionally, we are interested in systems of reaction-diffusion equations that are
compartmentalized. That is, where each compartment has a different
reaction-diffusion process and the interaction between them happens
*through* the intersection between the two compartments (e.g. a
[living cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology))).

### Compartments

We say that each compartment, denoted by $\Omega^k$, is an open, bounded,
connected subset of Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, with Lipschitz boundary
$\partial\Omega^k$ and space dimension $d=2$ or $d=3$. Moreover, we require
that the compartments are the non-overlapping decomposition of an open, bounded,
and connected domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, such that,
$$
  \overline{\Omega}=\bigcup_{k=1}^{K}\overline{\Omega}^k\quad\text{and}\quad\Omega^k\cap\Omega^l=\emptyset\quad \text{with}\quad k\ne l,
$$
where $K$ is the total number of compartments.

### Species
We will distinguish species within the same compartment with a subscript,
usually $i$, and species on different compartments with a superscript, usually
$k$. For example, $u_i^k$ is the $i$-th species on the $k$-th compartment.
Furthermore, we will denote bold letters to refer to all $N^k$ species in the
$k$-th compartment, i.e, $\bm{u}^k:=[u^k_1,\dots,u_{N^k}^k]^T$.

### Transport

We then characterize transport with a **diffusive flux operator**,
$\mathcal{D}_i^k$, for the $i$-th species by
$$
\mathcal{D}^k_i\left(\bm{u}^k\right):=-\mathsf{D}^k_{i\star} \nabla \bm{u}^k,
$$
where $\mathsf{D}^k_{i\star}$ represents the $i$-th row of the self and
cross-diffusion tensor $\mathsf{D}^k$, in other words,
$\mathsf{D}^k_{i\star}\nabla\bm{u}^k:=\sum_{i=1}^{N^k}\mathsf{D}^k_{ij}\nabla u^k_j$.

### Reaction Network

A (bio-)chemical reaction is the transformation of one species to another, i.e,
$u_i^k\to u_j^k$. There are many natural processes that present a rich reaction
network. Particularly, we will represent the *deterministic* rate of change of
$u^k_i$ caused by chemical reactions with the **reaction operator**
$\mathcal{R}_i^k\left(\bm{u}^k\right)$. Such an operator is required to be a
Lipschitz function and be mass conservative.

### Membrane

We call *membranes* all the boundaries of the compartments. In particular, we
designate its geometry to be a $(d-1)$-manifold defined with respect to the
boundary of the compartments, i.e.,
$$
\Gamma^{kl}:=
  \left\{
  \begin{matrix}
    \partial\Omega_k\cap\partial\Omega_l, \quad& \text{if }k\ne l\quad& \text{interior boundaries}\\
    \partial\Omega_k\cap\partial\Omega,   \quad& \text{if }k =  l\quad& \text{exterior boundaries}.
  \end{matrix}
  \right.
$$
where $\partial\Omega$ represents the boundaries of the domain $\Omega$.


### Transmission Conditions

The transmission conditions refer to the flux rate at which compartment
species are transformed and moved across the membrane. It depends on the
concentration of species and the diffusion coefficients at
which species can move on the surroundings of the membrane. In our model, we say
that this equals to the outer flux $\mathcal{D}_i^k$ of the
species $i$ leaving the compartment $k$. It is defined by a general
**transmission condition**, $\mathcal{T}^{kl}_i$, that may take the form of
typical Robin boundary conditions as well as complex chemical reaction networks
for the different species touching the membrane, i.e.,
$$
\mathcal{D}_i^{k}\left(\bm{u}^k\right)\cdot\mathbf{n}^k = \mathcal{T}_i^{kl}\left(\bm{u}^k,\bm{u}^l\right)\qquad \text{on }\Gamma^{kl},
$$
where $\mathbf{n}^k$ is the outer normal vector on $\Omega^k$. As is natural,
the transmission conditions must be mass conservative.

### Strong Formulation

Joining all definitions from above, we obtain a *boundary value problem* (BVP)
which it reads as follow:

Given an initial condition ${u_{(0)}}_i^k$ and a final time $T$, find $u_i^k$
such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\partial_t u_i^k = -\nabla\cdot\mathcal{D}_i^k\left(\bm{u}^k\right) + \mathcal{R}_i^k\left(\bm{u}^k\right) &\qquad \text{in }\Omega^k\times(0,T),\\
\mathcal{D}_i^k\left(\bm{u}^k\right)\cdot \mathbf{n}^k = \mathcal{T}^{kl}_i(\bm{u}^k,\bm{u}^l) &\qquad \text{on }\Gamma^{kl}\times(0,T),\\
u_i^k = {u_{(0)}}_i^k &\qquad \text{in }\Omega^k,
\end{aligned}
$$
for every $k,l=1,\ldots,K$, and $i=1,\ldots,N^k$.
