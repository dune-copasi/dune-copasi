This discussion is accompanied with a description of various advanced features, such as coupling of domains and cut cells, grid modifications such as adaptation and moving domains, high order discretizations and node level performance, non-smooth multigrid methods, and multiscale methods. A brief discussion on current and future development directions of the framework concludes the paper.}

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal dynamics of a variety of proteins is, among other things, regulated by post-translational modifications of these proteins. Such modifications can thus influence stability and biochemical activities of the proteins, activity and stability of their upstream targets within specific signalling pathways. Commonly used mathematical tools for such protein–protein (and/or protein-mRNA) interactions in single cells, namely, Michaelis–Menten and Hill kinetics, yielding a system of ordinary differential equations, are extended here into (non-linear) partial differential equations by taking into account a more realistic spatial representation of the environment where these reactions occur. In the modelling framework under consideration, all interactions occur in a cell divided into two compartments, the nucleus and the cytoplasm, connected by the semipermeable nuclear membrane and bounded by the impermeable cell membrane. Passive transport mechanism, modelled by the so-called Kedem–Katchalsky boundary conditions, is used here to represent migration of species throughout the nuclear membrane. Nonlinear systems of partial differential equations are solved by the semi-implicit Rothe method. Examples of two spatial oscillators are shown. Namely, these are the circadian rhythm for concentration of the FRQ protein in Neurospora crassa and oscillatory dynamics observed in the activation and regulation of the p53 protein following DNA damage in mammalian cells.}

  abstract = {Nektar++ is an open-source software framework designed to support the development of high-performance scalable solvers for partial differential equations using the spectral/hp element method. High-order methods are gaining prominence in several engineering and biomedical applications due to their improved accuracy over low-order techniques at reduced computational cost for a given number of degrees of freedom. However, their proliferation is often limited by their complexity, which makes these methods challenging to implement and use. Nektar++ is an initiative to overcome this limitation by encapsulating the mathematical complexities of the underlying method within an efficient C++ framework, making the techniques more accessible to the broader scientific and industrial communities. The software supports a variety of discretisation techniques and implementation strategies, supporting methods research as well as application-focused computation, and the multi-layered structure of the framework allows the user to embrace as much or as little of the complexity as they need. The libraries capture the mathematical constructs of spectral/hp element methods, while the associated collection of pre-written PDE solvers provides out-of-the-box application-level functionality and a template for users who wish to develop solutions for addressing questions in their own scientific domains.
