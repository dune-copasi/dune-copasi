  @brief Class instance creator

  A factory should be able to create an instance of a type out of @ref DataContext.
  This is done by the definition of an specialization of the class Factory and a static function create.
  One thing to take into account is that data context can only store unique values of certain data type.
  This is quite restrictive is the constructor of T contains repeated or very common types (e.g. `T{int,int,double}`),
  in shuch case, is best to wrap these values in a unique struct that contains all of these.
