/**
 * @brief Helper class to redirect std::ostream to a functor
 * @details This object takes an `std::ostream` and redirects its input to a
 * stream buffer owned by this class. When the stream syncs, it forwards the
 * resulting strings views to a functor. It has the effect to redirect the
 * output stream to the functor.
 *
 * This `std::ostream` does not directly output data, but forwards any input to
 * its associated functor. It can operate in two different modes:
 *
 * - In line-buffered mode, the buffer will only output complete lines that have
 * been terminated by a newline character. In particular, this mode will ignore
 * any explicit flushing of the C++ stream. This mode is capable of exactly
 * reproducing the original output layout as designed by the user of the
 * `std::ostream`, but messages may appear later than expected when the user
 *   explicitly flushes the C++ stream.
 *
 * - In unbuffered mode, the buffer will always forward all pending data
 * every time the C++ stream is flushed. As most logging sinks are line-oriented
 * and insert an additional newline after each log message, this will not
 * correctly reproduce the original layout of the output. As a lot of people use
 * `std::endl` instead of just `"\n"` for ending their lines, this mode will not
 * forward empty lines to the logging system to avoid empty lines after every
 * regular line printed to the C++ stream.
